# Livestream (BROKEN)

Note: You won't be able to get this code to run. Here was how the code was originally supposed to work: You run scraper.py in one command prompt, which loads the worldometers.com/coronavirus website every 60 seconds looking for updates. Simultaneously, you run visualizer.py in another command prompt, which reads from the dataStream.txt file that scraper.py outputs, and turns that data into a 30 FPS video output that can then be livestreamed. However, when I try to run this code these days, I get a 403 Forbidden error from worldometers. This probably means none of you will be able to get the livestream up and working, either. I'm only including this code here in case anybody is curious in my coding style/process/workflow, but not necessarily seeing it work in action.

# Nervous Emoji

Note: This visualization seems to downplay the severity of the virus, which I now regret. At the time of making it (Feb 12, 2020), there had been 2 deaths outside China. I was worried that people were treating this outbreak the same way they had the 2014 Ebola outbreak, which was panic and xenophobia. So, I was trying to provide a more levelled perspective to convey to people to not overreact. However, in hindsight, this visualization made the virus seem less deadly than it truly became, which was my mistake. I'm posting this code in the spirit of open-sourcing everything, but I hope people don't use it to downplay the virus further. (If the code is edited to show recent data, it should accurately reflect how serious it is.)

# With Guzheng

# With Guzheng Sound

Heard at 0:00 in the 2020-03-08 video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrgYEdb-Fls

Note: chinaCOVID19deathCount.txt is a timetable describing all the times that a guzheng sound should play (in 44,000 Hz samples) If you run coronasounder.py, it will read that timetable, and use the 6 sounds in the "sounds" folder to play a Guzheng sound at each time interval listed! Also, sometimes, Windows Media Player is unable to play the output file. When that happens, I just load the .wav file successfully in Audactiy (https://www.audacityteam.org/), and then save it as a new file.
